Week 2 (to be completed by Wednesday, January 26)
Study material
Our target this week is to learn how to work with branches in git, including resolving conflicts when they arise, as well as to learn what goes in a requirements document, including use cases and user stories.
Start by completing this course (login with Passport York credentials). It is a very nice, detailed introduction to local and remote branches, including resolving conflicts. Even though this course is using git in the command-line fashion, it is important to understand it thoroughly. A lot of the command-line terminology shows up in Eclipse. If you are pressed for time, you can skip Section 5 on stashing changes, although it is a powerful tool you should learn how to use at some point.
Once you have completed the course above, watch this instructor video on how to do some of the command-line operations in Eclipse, using Egit. You can find the Egit documentation through Eclipse (Help â†’ Help Contents). This tutorial is also quite helpful (you might want to become familiar with the way Egit decorates icons - scroll towards the end of the tutorial).
Finally, complete Sections 2 and 3 of this course (login with Passport York credentials). It is a very nice introduction to requirements and use cases. I particularly like the fact that clarity is emphasized over formality. For your Requirements document, also focus on a clear set of requirements and use cases without worrying about including all possible sections or following a particular format.
