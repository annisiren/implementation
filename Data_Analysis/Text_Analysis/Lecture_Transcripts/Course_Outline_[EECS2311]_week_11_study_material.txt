Week 11 (to be completed by Wednesday, April 6)
Study material
Our topic this week is refactoring. As everybody is certainly busy, it is an optional topic.
If you do not know how to rename variables in Eclipse using the refactoring facilities, I highly recommend watching the first part of this short video.
For more on refactoring, you can watch this instructor video on it. Feel free to do this after the term is finished.
