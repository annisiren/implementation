Week 11 (to be completed by Wednesday, April 6)
Due
The only due item this week is your Peer Assessment 4 feedback on the design documents you have received, due on Wednesday, April 6.
You should of course be working towards completing your project so you can present all its features at the progress report meeting that will take place this week, similar to what we did prior to the midterm submission. These meetings will take place on either Monday or Wednesday using the lecture Zoom link as follows:
