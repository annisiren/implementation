Set alarm. 
Lemon thing that i want to mention. 
For sure he's not in this course. 
It's different than other courses in the science on the one side done told you exactly what to do because it's more like a real software system and you said have to figure things out a little bit. 
But on the other hand i plan things so i'm available to help you with that as much as possible right so. 
Error:
I said that every year i must see this don't believe me that you can email me we can talk anytime. 
By the end of the ghost people figure out at douglas and i truly mean that so i do that already this week a couple years that i can't believe me and you guys email me and we'll talk soon hopefully. 
That helped you i sort of. 
Get a better feel as to what's up. 
But you need to do for this project if you're still uncertain yourself 52 this talk with your teammates they might be able to help you along that way as well but if you feel that in this course you're still not don't know where you're going you definitely should talk to me in. 
We can figure that out. 
I'm so mom it is i understand italian gene course and a demanding course. 
Error:
But i'm here to try to help people along with that. 
Find so i feel free to use me as much as you. 
Nate. 
Error:
Alright. 
Along those lines out the fact that doesn't mentioned in my update last week. 
I am a little concerned that many teams have not made significant progress in the project i'm hoping today thinks will be better at least by last week. 
I had nothing that could sell me any outfits from your system that looks like the expected output. 
So which is it is only 18 days left and the. 
Record that was quite complex so if you have nothing today i'm seriously considering that so you'll be able to. 
We don't develop something that's comes close to meeting the requirements. 
By the midterm submission. 
Error:
So. 
Maybe i'd like to get a little bit feel phone from you how weather is my concern for that is responding or not. 
Do you feel that. 
Maybe we should extend the deadline to come sometime so there is an option to to sort of allow you to work a little bit further after reading week with them in their submission but then of course this may affect other courses other m you may have in 2017. 
Error:
Yeah he's there any open knows anybody who would like to share a stew that would be a good thing or a bad thing or what do you think.

Ok google hello. 
Hello professor i was wondering so our submission is due on 27th is after the reading week right. 
Yes at the end of it with you. 
Okay i like. 
I honestly person i feel a little bit difficult for us to do the report because we are not. 
Can you tell darcy's becomes little difficult to perish things and you know the kind of make sure everyone's on the same tribe. 
Error:
A person with a mind if we can have a little more time for the mitchum submission to make sure that you know. 
Error:
Like. 
What i want to say is like. 
Like. 
The first parts like your uncle we get kind of things rolling it would be a good idea to have some extra time if it's possible. 
So you have some more time like maybe go campus we have some more time to kind of. 
Get the group together kind of a start making sure everything's okay. 
Error:
Right now it's okay like the wave you're doing things but. 
Get the feeling it would be better like when we are drinking pearsonville working group in person. 
It just makes it a little bit easier. 
Error:
How much does a session are you do you have in your mind. 
Well it could know there'll be more than awake right now. 
They must have. 
Error:
Go ahead.. 
Error:
Hi professor so about if the deadline should be extended. 
I just talked to miss him that my team has done a little. 
At least i'm able to play the guitar. 
Cubs. 
But when it comes to. 
Other things. 
We just have to figure out how to deconstruct the music xml file to get what we want and also how to how to code the drawing because. 
Where do we get the symbols from. 
So we have lots of questions for you today are we will ask them. 
Oh i think it'll be good to have just a little more time cuz for us who are no relief. 
In tune with music. 
And would already know much about reading music i find that this project super challenging for us. 
And i just found this course. 
I'm always available to help with any music related questions you that comes up. 
Error:
I guess i just heard from the beginning. 
You don't necessarily understand the load about music a little bit. 
Error:
But cuz you see the outfits for any but you can see the output already in the music or any of their own line previews. 
I want to mention. 
Something you decide about how to actually throw those symbols i meant to say to your public as well you have to i think my in my opinion do that yourself the best free throw them lines and circles and things like that right so use. 
If you could. effects use the canvas class to the create-a-sim graphics in does throw the lines and all the things yourself right so there's nothing magic to it innocence we just have to do it. 
Directly so look at what the output supposed to be for some of the examples in which i provide. 
You and then just try to do that as a first-time i'd list. 
I guess there's a lot of parts of to the project and qantas flight 2405. 
Most of them but i got is about extending but. 
We'll see high. 
It goes. 
Let me go to hardrock next. 
Requested. 
Starting next week is allowed going to be in prison. 
Online. 
So the class will be impression but i will be online at the same time so i will be on zoom. 
At the same time until the recording. 
The other session. 
For the labs elections. 
For both so. 
For labs i will have one ta online and wanted in person in lecture aldi. 
Error:
Error:
Okay let me see i thought. 
See what question care. 
Yes i guess before we can continue this discussion has any important question that said which is what should be done by either made the deadline. 
Error:
Start having the course description. 
Basically the examples are provided should be done by the m a not resuscitate rotation now depending on how things go out to be impossible then maybe we'll just a little bit but at least we'll expect to see. 
The starter examples to work and some of the other things. 
Progress. 
So in a sense it's noticeably different that when the project is except by the meantime we don't necessarily expect to see something that perfect like nobody's going to see it at all the parts of the system of working like they. 
The xml is poorest then. 
You'll create ventano's oxygen gets produced again it doesn't have to be perfect but we have to say that you actually done the work so far. 
Error:
Error:
Error:
Yeah and then some of the message i'm getting here have to do with i guess getting some feedback from us after reading week about the progress in the in the project there is something to eat for sure with the commander line i was thinking that next week. 
I'll have a meeting with its team like i will split. 
Monday and wednesday and then have a schedule for his team-mates with me. 
For 50 minutes so i can see what you have give you some feedback. 
Before you. 
Will get you anyway cuz it was very the last time i will see you first. 
I'll be up waiting like to talk to you anyway by the taste of the last formal meeting with us would be next week and there's a concern that maybe they won't be enough there by next week for me to provide useful feedback at 2 to the teams if we extended deadline then. 
You guys could have really weak then we have a meeting right after so we do this 15-minute meeting with it stayed right after reading week give you some people again i get a few more days to to fix things and then submit so there's definitely something to be said for doing it that way. 
I did see that someone said the leave adelina's is right so i just need to know everybody is on the same page so i made a quick call to. 
Desiccated feel as to how. 
People. 
Feel about it. 
If you don't mind just give me a quick answer. so i get the classroom feels about your overall. 
Error:
Error:
Error:
Error:
Error:
Error:
Okay i'm in other expected from this vast majority is for extending the deadline. 
Error:
Error:
Error:
Error:
Error:
Yeah so. 
I have question answers for. 
Everybody except one so it's probably doesn't even matter. 
I'm going to end up all year. 
Error:
So that i can see the results are pretty overwhelming themes of extending the deadline. 
I do understand that this may not work well for everybody 8515 feels like it started want to stick and do things earlier i'll be happy to discuss it with them and make a more personalized kind of approach that if they prefer body looks like i probably will be extending the deadline. 
Took my date. 
The majority of the class. 
Okay so what i'll do then is when i send my updates later today i'll let you know if the attachments and thinks things will go. 
Weather in that regard. 
Error:
All right have you send all this that's all i have for today i'm before saw the recording i did mention and do it again. there is a deadline tonight to submit. 
Good luck on your requirements on the requirements document. 
The two requirements you received so make sure to do that before midnight. 
And i will have another. husbands. 
Which. 
If i am extending the deadline so i might excited and $4 for a little bit so i'll let you guys know later today. 
Error:
Excuse me sir can i have questions you're going to extend be user manual i & m submission deadline. 
They both are. 
Only m i mentioned i like that. 
From your peers as well as well as myself. 
I mean i can only do both i guess 15 minutes 14 different class anyway i'm happy to do that outside class also. 
Supper will be able to extend the deadline for that a little bit as well to to allow what i want is. 
Games to have something meaningful to submit in-depth look getting feedback right if nothing works over there's no output then you're not going to get very useful feedback so it would make sense to. 
Maybe give you a bit more time to work on the project. 
Submitted photo. 
Hope your feedback and then received a feedback. 
Let's a molestar same time as you received my feedback right after being awake so that you have a few more days to. 
Accommodate everything. 
And your and your submission. 
Execute. 
Alright. 
Having a cycle that we still have to i guess discuss what actually happened to the questions the whole class has about what to do with the project in so long so i move to that finish. 
With a question for the whole class you guys can go into your breakout rooms and work with your teammates and the first call me into specific questions about your project. 
But i'm anything that would be for a good with whole class to to sort of fear then let's discuss it down song. 
Error:
I got amaya. 
I was wondering for the prototype that's due next week or if you extend the time we supposed to push our a project into the master branch or. 
You're supposed to push it into master branch okay i just want to clear on that one. 
That's the way we'll use them at the branch right it is it's the brand that has what michael actual release of the software right not something that's in between with a half develop featuring something that we can sort of give out there to say alpha testers for the project. 
You put. 
What's the thing you want feedback on on the master branch and that's what the other team will will get involved with. 
Instructions for the user as to how to actually access all the features of yourself to her right so you might want to have some attractions in case you need some truck setup for your system in our case around everything through great alright so i expect that. 
This wouldn't really be any need for installation cycling is ruby check out the thing from utah and run the run task incredible in his children so we make sure that this is how it works and then it really comes down to basically describing uruguay and how to access some pictures if you have some cool pictures that you think that appears our assault marcus a mission to make sure not to miss then you should put those in the museum on your line give us some examples of how to use the system it's not something else. 
Cool things. 
Like least i think of it as one branch of the time if you want. 
Error:
Basically the things that usually bullying are either developed or the master rounds everything else you should necessarily need to pull right so. 
Yes so it does mean that if you're using your own picture browns you may need to switch to the video brown's pool what you think he'll put up there. 
Then switch back to your individual of your future branch and emerge from the developments to to get any changes into your fridge branch if you wanted those back into the toilet. 
The. 
The workflow innocence would get low that we discussed this last week has to do with. 
With all of those things right so he's definitely important to make sure you are very comfortable switching between branches and merging into the current branch. 
Notice of my nuts all the changes in the system. 
Error:
Error:
Pusher innocence if. 
Bwb by yourself and nothing's happened about your teammates are doing things then you should making sure it wouldn't it's not a bad idea to. 
Couple things everyday make sure you measure it into your code. 
Asia developing other things to avoid having to do a lot of work into merging the changes at the end right so if innocence you better go or to a compliment something that. 
You think does not affect your teammates still. 
He might be a good idea to to pulled things are they doing so that to make sure that there's no conflicts that will become harder and harder to resolve the longer you take to actually do the marriage. 
Error:
Error:
Okay. 
Questions for sure the main one of the main things i want people to take out of this course is days. 
Clear understanding of gates and bronson see how it works it's basically. 
Absolute requirement this days in the end of something to say to be comfortable using gate and understanding the concepts of branches and things like that. 
Error:
Error:
Alright next question i don't see anything. 
Just yet. 
Error:
Error:
Error:
Error:
Alright so let me prepare the breakout rooms. 
But still take questions if you have them for another mediation. 
Error:
Error:
Error:
Hi-so sing no questions i will open the bathrooms and. 
As always coming to discuss things i expect maybe more things today will want my help so zoom does somi the request of the coming into one after the other so. 
You may be a little bit before i get to you but i will definitely get to you. 
Alright see you in there.
