Week 8 (to be completed by Wednesday, March 16)
Lab task
Each student must draw two diagrams describing an aspect of the system.
The two diagrams cannot be of the same type. Choose two of the following types of diagrams: activity, class, sequence, and object.
Groupmates can choose the same type of diagram but they must describe a different part of the system, e.g. one prepares a sequence diagram related to XML parsing, another prepares a sequence diagram related to the play functionality.
The TAs in the lab session can provide feedback on how to improve your diagrams.
