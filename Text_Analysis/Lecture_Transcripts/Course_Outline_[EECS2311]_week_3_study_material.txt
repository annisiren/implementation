Week 3 (to be completed by Wednesday, February 2)
Study material
Our target this week is to finish the material on git by learning about git workflows.
First off, for those of you still unsure about merges, when do they fail, what is a fast-forward merge etc, you might find this explanation helpful.
Next, we will learn about a method to organize the branches in our repository called Gitflow. Read the original description, as well as this explanation.
These slides present the main points from the above links, and describe how branches must be organized in EECS 2311.
Finally, this is not required studying, but this is a handy page that lists everything you might need to remember about command-line git. It includes instructions on how to make your README file on github look nice.
