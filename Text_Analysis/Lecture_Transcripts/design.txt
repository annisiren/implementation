Design document

• Documents the high-level structure of the 

software system

• What are the important classes?

• What are the important methods?

• How do they interact with each other?

• What are important objects that get created at 

runtime?

• How are they connected to each other?

2

Design document

• Audience: Developers

• The customer / user never sees the design 

document

• Goal: An experienced developer that is 

unfamiliar with the system should be able to 
read the document and get a clear idea of the 
system’s design (ideally also the rationale for 
the design).

3

Diagrams are crucial

• A design document without diagrams is a poor 

design document

• Need at least:

• A class diagram depicting the important 

classes and how they are connected (static 
view)

• A sequence diagram depicting important 
objects and how they interact at runtime 
(dynamic view)

4

Class diagrams

• Select the important classes / methods of your 
system and present the relationships between 
them in a UML class diagram

• Draw multiple diagrams rather than a single 

huge one

• DO NOT show every class in the system and / 

or every method in each class

• Automatic tools do a poor job of creating class 

diagrams. Draw your own diagrams!

7

Sequence diagrams

• Depict how objects interact at runtime

• Time passes from top to bottom

• Need to draw sequence diagrams for all 

important runtime scenarios of your system

• Again, show relevant / useful information, omit 

unnecessary details

• See tutorial links on course website

Learn a diagram tool

• As a software engineer, you will often 

need to create design diagrams

• Find a drawing tool that works for you and 

learn it well

• See link to list of tools on course website

• diagrams.net is a free web-based tool 

that supports UML diagrams
