Week 6 (to be completed by Wednesday, March 2)
Due
This week lasts for two weeks due to Reading Week.
By Sunday, February 20, each team must submit their prototype for Peer Assessment 2 (see link on eClass page).
By Sunday, February 27, each student has to submit feedback on the prototypes and User Manuals that are assigned to them in PeerScholar. A rubric for how your feedback will be graded has been added to the Assess Phase description.
There is no study material or lab task due this week. Instead, each team will have a progress report meeting with their customer/manager/instructor and, perhaps more importantly, the TA that will mark the midterm submission. These meetings will take place on either Monday or Wednesday using the lecture Zoom link as follows:
