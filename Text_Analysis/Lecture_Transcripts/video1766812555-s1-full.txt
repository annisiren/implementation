But basically you you know everything you need to do you need to prepare. 
Everything else in the robotic right of the documents and the code and. 
Your submission will designated be a link to your github so. 
It's only basically a matter of formality actually making a submission.

Error:
I'm not sure what you mean exactly. 
In the in the music xml we have basically a sequence of notes right so one comes after the other. 
Right that'll. 
In a row unless there's the court tag that we discussed other means they're at the same time otherwise. 
Presenting them to these aries 18 the duckling the order you see them in the music. 
Xml aquatune they have the order of the notes modders it's not like. 
I tried the second note starts after the first note will finish again unless there's a chord tag chord right which means that those two notes are at the same time.

Error:
I have also another question care about. 
The dam park. 
Location from toronto for the damn tabs. 
Error:
I assume you mean okay you have a note you don't know which line or space between lines to put it right so. 
That has the time in based on the page right so you'll say that there's a correspondence between the page and where you put it which i opposed it about on the discussion board. 
I basically the piece tells you which location in the. 
In a stop in those five power lines to actually put the note right so if it's before then goes in the first place between the two bottom lines right and then it goes after that so. 
The correspondences standard music notation you can find that anywhere on the internet but it's also important. 
Okay. looks like you guys are getting down to the nitty-gritty is good. 
Any further questions about. 
The project of this month.

The question is what is expectation for the meter. 
Error:
Thermistor. 
How you mean exactly in a sentence definition is what was on the beginning write the description of the project and discussion with the customers will decide whether their requirements and expectation is to to fulfill these requirements as best as possible. 
Right now i do understand that. 
If you're concerned about that say no bugs whatsoever then for sure we're not going to be very picky about it at this one. 
After the vision we will go through discussing a bug reports and things like that so. 
You have a chance to to fix some of those issues but maybe all the basic functionality that we've discussed will expect her to to see.

Questions about this feel free to. 
The boston.

Edge cases are all other examples. 
I mean that you should make the best of mission you can as a team you can decide how far you can take your testing you definitely should be able to handle this dismal examples that i gave you some more than welcome to get advanced maybe. 
A bit of a challenge as long as we have the basic functionality than giving getting to. 
Some of the more advanced pictures if you were. 
Right so for sure part of the meetings today is to try to establish with the customer. 
Exactly what is it that they care about today in based on what you've done with right.
