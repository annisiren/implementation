Week 1 (to be completed by Wednesday, January 19)
Study material
Our target this week is to learn the basics of git and github.
Start by making sure that all team members have completed the setup demonstrated in lecture.
The lecture slides list all the steps for that setup.
A video of the first lecture is also available.
Next, read the first three chapters of the Pro Git Book. Focus on the concepts of version control, not the command-line syntax, as we will use git through Eclipse. This set of slides describes the important concepts from these chapters as well.
For those of you that prefer videos to reading, this course is a great introduction to git (login with Passport York credentials). It also focuses on the command-line syntax of git which will not be a focus in this course, so focus more on the version control concepts.
